Two samples work well with Linux Box!
They are tested.

Note: when you run the codes in the notebooks, please take one cell by one cell,
don't do "restart & run all", as graphical animation takes time to run in a sequence
of frames, you have to wait each frame display.

Unfortunately, we cannot run the samples of this Lab on Mac, as it does not support X11 window.
